# ✅ Customer User Setup Complete!

## What Was Completed

### 1. ✅ Database Tables Created
All necessary tables for customer/user functionality already exist in Supabase:
- **user_profiles** - User profile information
- **bookmarks** - User favorite products
- **notifications** - User notifications
- **notification_settings** - User notification preferences
- **activity_logs** - User activity tracking
- **order_items** - Detailed order information

### 2. ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) Policies Applied
Created comprehensive security policies to ensure:
- Users can only access their own data
- Users can read, insert, and update their own profiles
- Users can manage their own bookmarks and notifications
- Users can only see their own orders and order items
- Authentication is required for sensitive operations

**Migration Applied:** `setup_user_rls_policies`

### 3. ✅ Supabase Authentication Implemented
- **Created AuthContext** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`)
  - Manages user authentication state globally
  - Handles session persistence
  - Provides user profile data
  - Includes sign out functionality

- **Updated LoginModal** (`src/components/LoginModal.jsx`)
  - Real Supabase Auth sign up
  - Real Supabase Auth sign in
  - Password validation
  - Error handling
  - Loading states

### 4. ✅ App Integration
- **Updated App.jsx** - Wrapped app with AuthProvider
- **Updated EcommercePlatform.jsx** - Integrated useAuth hook
- All components now have access to authentication state

## How It Works

### User Registration Flow
1. User clicks "Sign Up"
2. Fills in name, email, and password (with confirmation)
3. Supabase creates auth account
4. User profile is created in `user_profiles` table
5. User is automatically signed in
6. Success message displayed

### User Login Flow
1. User clicks "Log In"
2. Enters email and password
3. Supabase validates credentials
4. If valid, session is created
5. User profile is fetched from database
6. User is authenticated and can access profile features

### Authentication State Management
- `AuthContext` automatically tracks auth state
- Listens to auth state changes
- Persists sessions across page reloads
- Provides user and profile data to all components

## User Features Now Available

✅ **User Registration** - Create new accounts
✅ **User Login** - Sign in to existing accounts  
✅ **Profile Management** - View and edit user profiles
✅ **Orders History** - View past orders
✅ **Bookmarks** - Save favorite products

✅ **Activity Logs** - Track user activity

## Database Security

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled with appropriate policies:
- Users can only see their own data
- Users cannot access other users' information
- Authentication required for sensitive operations
- Public read access where appropriate (products)
