# ✅ Supabase Integration Complete!

Your TechMart Haiti e-commerce platform is now fully connected to Supabase! 🎉

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Database Schema Created ✅
Created four main tables in Supabase PostgreSQL:

- **Products** - Product catalog with pricing, stock, ratings, and discounts
- **Orders** - Order management with status tracking
- **Customers** - Customer profiles and purchase history
- **Coupons** - Discount codes (percentage & fixed)

### 2. Sample Data Inserted ✅
Pre-populated your database with realistic data:
- 6 products (Electronics, Fashion, Shoes)
- 4 orders (various statuses)
- 3 customers with purchase history
- 3 discount coupons

### 3. Security Configured ✅
Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
- Products: Public read access, authenticated write
- Orders/Customers: Authenticated access only
- Coupons: Public read for active ones

### 4. React App Integration ✅
Created complete React integration:

**Files Created:**
```
src/
├── lib/
│   └── supabase.js           # Supabase client configuration
├── hooks/
│   ├── useProducts.js        # Fetch products from DB
│   ├── useOrders.js          # Fetch orders from DB

│   └── useCoupons.js         # Fetch coupons from DB
└── types/
    └── database.types.ts     # TypeScript types for database
```

### 5. UI Improvements ✅
- Added loading spinners while fetching data
- Real-time data from Supabase
- Updated price range filter to match product prices (0-30,000 HTG)

### 6. Documentation ✅
